# **üîπ Software-First Approach & Next Steps for Incorporating Hardware**

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Software-First Approach (MVP Stage)**
The **current MVP is entirely software-based**, leveraging **multi-cloud AI compute from CoreWeave, Lambda Labs, Vast.ai, and other providers**. This allows Solyx AI to:

‚úÖ **Test scheduling & orchestration (DRM, CMO, SDN) without owning hardware.**
‚úÖ **Optimize AI workloads across latency, energy efficiency, and cost dynamically.**
‚úÖ **Validate user demand before committing to physical infrastructure investment.**
‚úÖ **Scale AI compute capacity on-demand via third-party GPUs.**

---

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Next Steps: Transitioning to a Hybrid Model (Software + Hardware)**
As Solyx AI gains traction, we can **gradually introduce proprietary hardware infrastructure (MetaPods) while keeping software orchestration as the foundation**.

### **üîπ Stage 1: Hybrid AI Compute (Partial Hardware Integration)**
At this stage, Solyx AI **continues leveraging third-party GPUs** but begins **deploying its own MetaPod clusters** in **select locations** to **reduce dependency on external providers**.

‚úÖ **What changes?**
‚úîÔ∏è Introduce **dedicated GPU clusters** for high-priority customers (LLM training, AI enterprises).
‚úîÔ∏è **Split workloads** between **third-party cloud GPUs & in-house hardware** for cost savings.
‚úîÔ∏è **Further optimize SDN-based workload routing** to balance between **owned GPUs and leased GPUs**.

‚úÖ **What stays the same?**
‚úîÔ∏è **DRM, CMO, and SDN logic still manage all job scheduling & workload routing**.
‚úîÔ∏è **Billing, user dashboard, and AI Compute Marketplace remain unchanged**.

üîπ **Impact on Infrastructure**
- **Deploy bare-metal GPU servers (A100s, H100s) in key data center locations.**
- **Leverage Kubernetes for on-prem & cloud-based GPU management.**
- **Deploy edge-based AI compute nodes to serve low-latency AI inference workloads.**

üîπ **Impact on Monetization**
- **More predictable pricing for reserved GPU leases (AI-IaaS customers).**
- **Lower costs for on-demand AI compute (no third-party markups).**

---

### **üîπ Stage 2: Full AI Compute Network (MetaPods Deployed)**
At this stage, Solyx **fully owns and operates its own GPU infrastructure**, with **MetaPods acting as decentralized AI compute clusters.**

‚úÖ **What changes?**
‚úîÔ∏è **No more reliance on external cloud GPU providers.**
‚úîÔ∏è **Solyx owns full-stack AI compute from hardware to software.**
‚úîÔ∏è **Optimized power consumption by dynamically shifting AI workloads based on energy availability.**

üîπ **Impact on SDN (Networking Layer)**
- **Dedicated high-speed networking between MetaPods reduces AI job latency.**
- **Cloud egress costs are minimized since AI workloads stay within Solyx‚Äôs network.**

üîπ **Impact on Billing**
- **Lower AI compute prices due to cost reductions from in-house infrastructure.**
- **Better margins on AI-IaaS (reserved GPU leasing) since Solyx owns the infrastructure.**
