# Solyx AI - Decentralized AI Infrastructure

## Overview
Solyx AI is revolutionizing AI infrastructure with a decentralized, energy-efficient, and scalable approach to high-performance computing (HPC). Our MetaPod Distributed Hyperclusters leverage modular, micro data center (MDC) nodes to provide high-density AI compute without the constraints of traditional data centers.

By integrating advanced cluster management, software-defined networking (SDN), and carbon-aware workload orchestration, Solyx AI optimizes performance, reduces costs, and enables sustainable AI compute at scale.

## Repository Goal: MVP Development
This repository focuses on building and iterating the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for Solyx AI's core orchestration and resource management systems. The goal is to develop a working prototype that demonstrates:

- **Intelligent Resource Allocation**: Fine-grained, energy-aware scheduling for distributed AI workloads.
- **Network-Aware Orchestration**: Dynamic path computation and traffic engineering for high-performance networking.
- **Scalable & Modular Compute**: Kubernetes-based workload management across MetaPod nodes.
- **Sustainability & Cost Optimization**: Carbon-aware scheduling, demand response integration, and energy-efficient compute placement.

## Core Components
1. **Cluster Management & Orchestration (CMO)**
   - Dynamic workload scheduling based on compute availability, energy efficiency, and network performance.
   - Integration with Kubernetes, Ray, and Prometheus for monitoring and workload execution.

2. **Distributed Resource Manager (DRM)**
   - Fine-grained tracking and allocation of compute, memory, and hardware accelerators (GPUs, TPUs, FPGAs).
   - Energy-aware migration and quota enforcement for cost and sustainability optimization.

3. **Software-Defined Networking (SDN) Controller**
   - Adaptive traffic engineering and congestion-aware routing.
   - Latency-optimized, high-bandwidth interconnects for AI training and inference workloads.

## Development Roadmap
### 🚀 MVP Prioritization for Solyx AI

To ensure **Solyx AI's MVP** delivers maximum value while remaining **lean and scalable**, we prioritize workstreams and features based on **criticality for execution, feasibility, and market impact**.

---

## 1️⃣ Distributed Resource Management (DRM)
📌 *Objective:* Optimize **compute resource allocation** across distributed AI workloads with **energy efficiency & cost optimization**.

### Workstream Prioritization:
1. **(HIGH) Resource Allocation & Tracking** – 🏆 **Top Priority**
   - **Why?** This is the foundation of distributed compute orchestration. Without **real-time tracking**, nothing else (e.g., scheduling, optimization) can function.

2. **(MEDIUM-HIGH) Energy-Aware Scheduling**
   - **Why?** Renewable energy utilization is a **differentiator**, but MVP must first establish **basic scheduling** before **optimizing for energy-aware execution**.

3. **(MEDIUM) Quota Enforcement & Optimization**
   - **Why?** Essential for scaling **multi-tenant AI workloads**, but not critical for MVP.

### Prioritized Features:
- ✅ **(Must-Have)** Dynamic hardware allocation (CPU, GPU, TPU, FPGA)
- ✅ **(Must-Have)** Fine-grained resource tracking in real time
- 🔸 **(Nice-to-Have)** Energy price-aware job migration
- 🔹 **(Future)** Fair-share quota enforcement

---

## 2️⃣ Intelligent Orchestration & Scheduling
📌 *Objective:* Place **AI workloads dynamically** across **geographically distributed compute nodes**.

### Workstream Prioritization:
1. **(HIGH) Cluster Management & Orchestration (CMO)** – 🏆 **Top Priority**
   - **Why?** The backbone of workload execution. If workloads can't be placed & executed properly, the system fails.

2. **(MEDIUM-HIGH) Latency-Aware Workload Scheduling**
   - **Why?** AI models need **low-latency execution**, but this depends on having an established **CMO**.

3. **(MEDIUM) Demand-Response Optimization**
   - **Why?** Valuable for **cost savings & sustainability**, but **not an immediate MVP necessity**.

### Prioritized Features:
- ✅ **(Must-Have)** Workload placement logic for distributed execution
- ✅ **(Must-Have)** AI-driven job scheduling for resource optimization
- 🔸 **(Nice-to-Have)** Latency-aware job migration across sites
- 🔹 **(Future)** Smart-grid integration for energy-aware scheduling

---

## 3️⃣ Software-Defined Networking (SDN)
📌 *Objective:* Provide **real-time network intelligence** for **efficient AI workload routing**.

### Workstream Prioritization:
1. **(HIGH) Dynamic Traffic Routing** – 🏆 **Top Priority**
   - **Why?** AI workloads are **network-intensive**; without **intelligent traffic engineering**, compute efficiency suffers.

2. **(MEDIUM-HIGH) Failure Recovery & Fault Tolerance**
   - **Why?** **Resiliency is critical** but secondary to ensuring **basic traffic optimization**.

3. **(MEDIUM) Energy-Aware Network Optimization**
   - **Why?** Sustainability and **power-aware networking** are valuable but **not MVP blockers**.

### Prioritized Features:
- ✅ **(Must-Have)** AI-driven real-time network monitoring
- ✅ **(Must-Have)** Path optimization based on congestion & latency
- 🔸 **(Nice-to-Have)** Self-healing network routing
- 🔹 **(Future)** Renewable-energy-aware traffic steering

## 4️⃣ MetaPod Infrastructure & AI Workload Execution
📌 *Objective:* Deploy **MetaPod Micro MDCs** for **scalable distributed compute infrastructure**.

### Workstream Prioritization:
1. **(HIGH) MetaPod Compute Nodes** – 🏆 **Top Priority**
   - **Why?** The **physical compute foundation** must be in place before AI workloads can be executed.

2. **(MEDIUM-HIGH) Grid-Optimized AI Execution**
   - **Why?** Important for **long-term cost savings**, but **MVP must first focus on AI execution**.

3. **(MEDIUM) Security & Isolation**
   - **Why?** Critical but **secondary** to ensuring **AI workloads function**.

### Prioritized Features:
- ✅ **(Must-Have)** Modular compute nodes with direct-to-chip cooling
- ✅ **(Must-Have)** AI execution capability (containerized AI workloads)
- 🔸 **(Nice-to-Have)** Renewable-aware job scheduling
- 🔹 **(Future)** AI-driven threat detection & security automation
