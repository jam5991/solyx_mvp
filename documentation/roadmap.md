# **🔹 Step-by-Step Guide to Building the MVP**
This roadmap breaks down the MVP **into phases**, prioritizing **core functionalities first** while ensuring future scalability.

---

## **🔹 Phase 1: Core Infrastructure & Backend (Weeks 1-3)**
### **1️⃣ Set Up Job Scheduling & GPU Management (DRM Core)**
🔹 **Why First?**
- The **DRM (Distributed Resource Manager)** is the backbone of the system—it **tracks available GPUs, assigns jobs, and optimizes placement**.
- Without this, we **can’t allocate AI workloads dynamically**.

🔹 **Implementation Steps:**
✅ **Integrate Cloud GPU APIs** → Query **CoreWeave, Lambda Labs, Vast.ai** for available GPU instances.
✅ **Build GPU Resource Tracker** → Store **GPU availability, price, energy cost** in a database.
✅ **Implement Basic Job Scheduler** → Use **Ray, Kubernetes Jobs, or Slurm** to assign workloads.

🔹 **Deliverable:**
✔️ **Working backend that can allocate AI jobs to available cloud GPUs**.

---

### **2️⃣ Build Backend API (CMO Core)**
🔹 **Why Now?**
- The **CMO (Cluster Management & Orchestration)** exposes API endpoints for **submitting, tracking, and optimizing AI workloads**.

🔹 **Implementation Steps:**
✅ **Create FastAPI Service** → Expose REST endpoints for job submission & status checks.
✅ **Connect to the DRM (GPU Tracker)** → Fetch **available GPUs** before assigning jobs.
✅ **Implement Energy-Aware Scheduling** → Fetch **CAISO/ERCOT data**, adjust scheduling logic.

🔹 **Deliverable:**
✔️ **Users can submit AI jobs via API, and the system assigns GPUs dynamically**.

---

## **🔹 Phase 2: User Interface & Monitoring (Weeks 4-6)**
### **3️⃣ Develop Frontend UI (User Dashboard)**
🔹 **Why Now?**
- Users need a way to **submit jobs, track progress, and see real-time GPU usage**.

🔹 **Implementation Steps:**
✅ **Build Job Submission Form** → Users select **model, GPU type, pricing options**.
✅ **Implement Job Tracking Dashboard** → Shows **real-time status** using WebSockets.
✅ **Integrate Carbon-Aware Compute** → Display “**green AI” options** for energy-efficient jobs.

🔹 **Deliverable:**
✔️ **Users can submit AI jobs via a clean UI and see real-time execution progress.**

---

### **4️⃣ Implement Real-Time Monitoring & Logging**
🔹 **Why Now?**
- **Monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana) ensures transparency** in **GPU utilization, job execution, and system health**.

🔹 **Implementation Steps:**
✅ **Deploy Prometheus to track GPU usage & job metrics.**
✅ **Set up Grafana dashboards for real-time performance tracking.**
✅ **Integrate alerts for job failures & underutilized GPUs.**

🔹 **Deliverable:**
✔️ **A monitoring system that tracks AI compute usage in real-time.**

---

## **🔹 Phase 3: Advanced Scheduling & Monetization (Weeks 7-10)**
### **5️⃣ Implement SDN-Based Network Optimization**
🔹 **Why Now?**
- **Optimizing job placement based on latency & bandwidth improves performance**.

🔹 **Implementation Steps:**
✅ **Fetch real-time latency data between cloud GPU regions.**
✅ **Route workloads to the fastest, lowest-cost provider.**
✅ **Reduce cloud egress fees by keeping AI models near compute locations.**

🔹 **Deliverable:**
✔️ **AI jobs are scheduled based on network conditions, minimizing cost & latency.**

---

### **6️⃣ Implement Billing & Usage Tracking**
🔹 **Why Now?**
- To **monetize the platform**, we need **per-GPU-hour billing** and **long-term AI cluster leasing**.

🔹 **Implementation Steps:**
✅ **Track compute usage per user** (GPU hours, cost).
✅ **Integrate Stripe API for automated payments.**
✅ **Support reserved GPU leasing (AI-IaaS model).**

🔹 **Deliverable:**
✔️ **Users are billed for AI compute usage, enabling revenue generation.**

---

### **7️⃣ Expand AI Compute Marketplace (Pre-Configured Models)**
🔹 **Why Now?**
- Instead of giving raw GPU access, **offer pre-configured AI runtimes (Llama3, Stable Diffusion, BioAI, etc.)**.

🔹 **Implementation Steps:**
✅ **Build Dockerized AI Environments** → Pre-load popular AI models.
✅ **Enable “One-Click Model Execution”** → Users **select a model**, and it runs instantly.
✅ **Optimize GPU Selection for Models** → Ensure **best-fit hardware for each AI model**.

🔹 **Deliverable:**
✔️ **Users can instantly deploy AI models without manual setup.**
